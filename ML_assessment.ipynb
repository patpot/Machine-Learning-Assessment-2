    "#### 10% marks\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used distance metrics is the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance between two points in the Euclidean space (also known as $L_2$ norm) is defined as the length of the line segment between those two points. For example, if we have two points in 2D space (i.e. two samples consisting of two features), $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\{x_{0,0}, x_{0,1}\\}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_1 = \\{x_{1,0}, x_{1,1}\\}$, we can calculate the distance as:\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we need to calculate the difference between the first features of the two samples, the difference between the second features of the two samples, then square each of the differences, sum those squares, and calculate the square root of the resulting sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when we are dealing with points in nD space (corresponding to samples with n features) of the form $\\mathbf{x}_i = \\{x_{0,i}, x_{1,i}, \\dots, x_{n,i}\\}$, the procedure is very similar. To calculade the Euclidean disatnce, you need to calculate the difference between the corresponding features of two samples, square each of the differences, and calculate the square root of the resulting sum:\n",

    "\n",
    "In each decision node of a decision tree, this classifier splits the dataset into two or more parts according to a value of a certain feature in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of M samples $\\mathbf{x} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\} \\forall i=1..M$ with n features each $\\mathbf{x}_i = \\{x_{1,i}, \\dots, x_{n,i}\\}$, we could decide to split the dataset at the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ (numerical) feature at value $v$. This would mean splitting the dataset into:\n",
    "- the subset $\\mathbf{x_{<}} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i | x_{j,i} < v\\}$, which contains all the samples with the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ smaller than $v$ and\n",
    "- the subset $\\mathbf{x_{\\geq}} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i | x_{j,i} \\geq v\\}$, which contains all the samples with the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ greater or equal than $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we could decide to split a dataset at the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ feature which is categorical. If the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ feature of a sample $\\mathbf{x}_i$ can hold values $\\{\\texttt{child}, \\texttt{teen}, \\texttt{adult}\\}$, the resulting subsets would be:\n",
    "- the subset $\\mathbf{x_{\\texttt{child}}} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i | x_{j,i} = \\texttt{child}\\}$, which contains all the samples with the feature $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ equal to $\\texttt{child}$, \n",

    "\n",
    "In each node of the decision tree, the dataset is split according to the attribute $j$ which results in **the highest information gain** after the split. For categorical features, there is only one possible split (each category becomes a subset). For numerical features, it is neccessary to check all the possible values of split. For example, if the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ in the dataset has appeared with the values of $\\{1, 1.5, 2.7, 3.2, 5\\}$, you need to calculate the information gain for splitting the dataset at $v=1.5$ (into $\\mathbf{x_{< 1.5}}$ and $\\mathbf{x_{\\geq 1.5}}$), $v=2.7$, $v=3.2$, $v=5$.\n",
